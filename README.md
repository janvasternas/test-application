Small project to be able to show skills in GIT (clone, pull), Maven (build, start Jetty, add dependencies),and a simple
web project with Spring configuration and web. Small page with jQuery and bootstrap.

Starting
--------

Before getting to the interview it is good if you have cloned the project and ensured that you can run the tests and edit
the project files. You are free to use your editor of choice but I have only run it using Eclipse (4.2).

There is no need to studdy the project in detail, the exersize will be on a fairly high level, mainly focusing on ensuring
that you have skills in identifying code, making minor changes and navigate within the project.

For some of the exersize you need a password, that will be supplied later.
